# Hacktoberfest 2022
## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest, in its 9th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:
- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects
## How Does it Work?
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
#### Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate by adding the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic.
#### Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.
#### Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.
## Rules
- #### Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
- #### You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.
## Details
- #### The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
- #### If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
- #### If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- #### A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.
