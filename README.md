## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest, in its 9th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:
- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects
## How Does it Work?
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
#### Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate by adding the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic.
#### Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.
#### Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.
## Here's what you need to participate and complete Hacktoberfest:
 - Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
 - Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
 - Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
 - Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
 - The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
